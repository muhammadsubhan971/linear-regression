# Linear and Simple Regression Models

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate **linear regression** techniques using Python and `scikit-learn`. These notebooks showcase the application of both simple and multiple linear regression on a dataset related to student performance and job placement packages.

## Files in this Repository

1. **`lin_mul.ipynb`**: Demonstrates multivariate linear regression, using multiple features (e.g., CGPA) to predict a target variable like job placement packages.
   
2. **`simplereg.ipynb`**: Shows a simple linear regression model, where a single feature (CGPA) is used to predict job packages.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install the required libraries with:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
